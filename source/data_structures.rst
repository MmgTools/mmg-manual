Data structures
===============

In **mmg**, several data structures are defined in order to represent and 
manipulate different entities such as tetrahedra, triangles, or meshes.

The main data structure that is used throughout **mmg** is the mesh structure ``MMG5_Mesh``.
This structure contains the following fields:

.. c:struct:: MMG5_Mesh

    .. c:var: int dim
